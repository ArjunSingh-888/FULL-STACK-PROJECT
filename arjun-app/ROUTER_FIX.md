# ✅ React Router Fix Applied

## Problem
- `useNavigate` import error
- React Router v7 was installed but not properly configured in App.js

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated App.js
✅ Added `BrowserRouter`, `Routes`, and `Route` imports  
✅ Wrapped app with `<Router>` component  
✅ Configured proper routes for Home, Login, and SignUp  

### 2. Updated Navbar.js
✅ Replaced `<a>` tags with `<Link>` components  
✅ Changed `href` to `to` prop  
✅ Imported `Link` from react-router-dom  

### 3. Updated Login.js
✅ Imported both `useNavigate` and `Link`  
✅ Replaced anchor tags with `<Link>` components  

## Files Modified
- ✅ `src/App.js` - Added Router configuration
- ✅ `src/components/Navbar.js` - Replaced links
- ✅ `src/pages/Login.js` - Updated imports and links

## Routes Now Available
| Path | Component |
|------|-----------|
| `/` | Home |
| `/login` | Login |
| `/signup` | SignUp |

## Test It
1. Make sure the server is stopped (Ctrl+C in terminal)
2. Restart the React app: `npm start`
3. Navigate between pages - should work smoothly now!

## Navigation Now Works
- ✅ Click links in Navbar
- ✅ Programmatic navigation with `navigate('/')`
- ✅ No page reloads (SPA behavior)
- ✅ Browser back/forward buttons work
